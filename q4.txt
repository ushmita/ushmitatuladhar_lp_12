If I am hired as the consultant/PM to develop a mobile app or website for the startup custom designed/printed T-shirt manufacturing company, I would prefer Agile Software Development. I would first get the ideas from the client: what s/he wants in the app/website. Then, according to the requirements, I would gather a team to do the task. After a few modules are completed, the client will be asked to check them for approval. The features will be added or removed according to the requirements of the client. This process will continue until the project is completed. Finally, the app/website will be handed over to the client.
