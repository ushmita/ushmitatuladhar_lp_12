In a car manufacturing company, the role of Quality Assurance (QA) is to provide confidence that the quality requirements will be fulfilled. The QA should motivate and increase the confidence of the employees who make the parts of the car, design those parts as well as assemble those parts to meet up to the quality of the product required by the company. Also, the QA should also build the sense of confidence to the customers that the car they will be purchasing will not have compromised in terms of the quality stated by the company.

The role of Quality Control (QC) in the car manufacturing company is to make sure that the product (car) fulfills the quality requirements of the company but does not relate to the process to build the product. It only concerns the quality of the product.
